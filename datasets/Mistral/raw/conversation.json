It requires a smooth, groomed surface and is typically faster than the classic technique. \n\nCross-country ski equipment consists of lightweight skis, boots, bindings, and poles. The boots are more flexible than those used in downhill skiing, allowing for better ankle movement and control. \n\nIn summary, cross-country skiing is a"
