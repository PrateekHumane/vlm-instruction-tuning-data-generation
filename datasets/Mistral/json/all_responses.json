      "Question": "What is the purpose of the woman wearing a net on her head?",
      "Answer": "The woman wearing a net on her head is likely using it to protect her hair from getting wet or dirty while cutting the cake. The net can help keep her hair out of the way and prevent it from getting mixed into the cake batter or getting in her face while she cuts the cake. This is especially important if the cake is large and requires both hands to cut it evenly. The woman is also using a chef's knife to mark the cake, which suggests that she is preparing to cut it into slices. The sink in the background might be used to wash the knife or the woman's hands after cutting the cake."
